# 🐍 Python OOP Concepts - Assignments Collection

Welcome to the complete list of Python Object-Oriented Programming assignments with explanations and code! Each concept is implemented with clarity and 💡 simplicity to help you learn better.

## 1. 🔁 Using `self`
Creates a `Student` class with `name` and `marks`. Demonstrates how to use `self` in a constructor and method.

## 2. 🧮 Using `cls`
`Counter` class tracks how many objects are created using class variables and `@classmethod`.

## 3. 🚗 Public Variables & Methods
`Car` class with public `brand` and method `start()`. Both are accessed from outside the class.

## 4. 🏦 Class Variables & Methods
`Bank` class with a class variable `bank_name`. Allows changing it using a class method.

## 5. ➕ Static Methods
`MathUtils` class with a static method `add(a, b)` that returns the sum.

## 6. 🚨 Constructors & Destructors
`Logger` prints messages when the object is created and destroyed.

## 7. 🔐 Access Modifiers
`Employee` class with public, protected (`_salary`) and private (`__ssn`) variables. Shows accessibility.

## 8. 👨‍🏫 Using `super()`
`Teacher` class inherits from `Person` and uses `super()` to call the parent constructor.

## 9. 📐 Abstract Classes
`Shape` is an abstract class with abstract method `area()`. `Rectangle` implements it.

## 10. 🐶 Instance Methods
`Dog` class with instance variables and method `bark()` that prints the dog's name.

## 11. 📚 Class Methods
`Book` class uses a class method to increase the count of total books.

## 12. 🌡️ Static Methods
`TemperatureConverter` has a static method `celsius_to_fahrenheit(c)`.

## 13. 🧩 Composition
`Car` class has an `Engine` object inside it, showing object composition.

## 14. 🧷 Aggregation
`Department` stores a reference to an `Employee` object (existing independently).

## 15. 💎 MRO & Diamond Inheritance
Demonstrates Method Resolution Order using classes `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.

## 16. 🪄 Function Decorators
Function decorator `log_function_call` prints a message before executing any function.

## 17. 🧵 Class Decorators
`add_greeting` adds a `greet()` method to a class using a decorator.

## 18. 🏷️ Property Decorators
`Product` class uses `@property`, `@setter`, and `@deleter` for managing `_price`.

## 19. 📞 `callable()` and `__call__()`
`Multiplier` class turns objects into callable functions using `__call__()`.

## 20. ⚠️ Custom Exception
`InvalidAgeError` is a user-defined exception raised if age is below 18.

## 21. 🔁 Custom Iterable Class
`Countdown` class implements `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to support for-loop iteration.
